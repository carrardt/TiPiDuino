  @note    On most architectures, interrupts are temporarily disabled in

           RGBW pixels). There's no easy fix for this, but a few

  // chosen for hue so that one's code can easily handle a contiguous color
  // wheel by allowing hue to roll over in either direction.
  hue = (hue * 1530L + 32768) / 65536;
  // Because red is centered on the rollover point (the +32768 above,
  // essentially a fixed-point +0.5), the above actually yields 0 to 1530,
  // where 0 and 1530 would yield the same thing. Rather than apply a
  // costly modulo operator, 1530 is handled as a special case below.

  // So you'd think that the color "hexcone" (the thing that ramps from
  // pure red, to pure yellow, to pure green and so forth back to red,
  // yielding six slices), and with each color component having 256
  // possible values (0-255), might have 1536 possible items (6*256),
  // but in reality there's 1530. This is because the last element in
  // each 256-element slice is equal to the first element of the next
  // slice, and keeping those in there this would create small
  // discontinuities in the color wheel. So the last element of each
  // slice is dropped...we regard only elements 0-254, with item 255
  // being picked up as element 0 of the next slice. Like this:
  // Red to not-quite-pure-yellow is:        255,   0, 0 to 255, 254,   0
  // Pure yellow to not-quite-pure-green is: 255, 255, 0 to   1, 255,   0
  // Pure green to not-quite-pure-cyan is:     0, 255, 0 to   0, 255, 254
  // and so forth. Hence, 1530 distinct hues (0 to 1529), and hence why
  // the constants below are not the multiples of 256 you might expect.
