attiny 85
=========
prefered option is to burn the desired bootloader with arduino IDE, using a recent version.
last successfull experience :
- arduino IDE 1.0.5 under linux
- ArduinoISP sketch upoloaded to an arduino nano compatible board
- paste attiny boards definitions at the end of /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/boards.txt
- select Attiny85 (internal 8Mhz clock)
- select programmer Arduino as ISP 
- burn boot loader

ialternatively, try these FUSE settings :
ATTiny85 @8Mhz, internal clock
avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as E2
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as DF
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as FF
avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:DF, L:E2)


atmega328
=========
ATMega328PU bootloader
avrdude -v -patmega328p -cstk500v1 -PCOM3 -b19200 -e -Ulock:w:0x3F:m -Uefuse:w:0x05:m -Uhfuse:w:0xDA:m -Ulfuse:w:0xFF:m
